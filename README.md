# Multi-Spectral-Object-Classification
---UNDER CONSTRUCTION---
WILL BE UPDATED AND COMPLETED VERY SOON
With this project we accomplish to classify different objects from images taken from microscope .I collected unique dataset , with objects like hair, blood , sand ,fibers etc in multiple displays(Transmission,Reflectance,Fluorescence , Polaroid) . Each display has its own Convolutional Neural Network to identify the objects.After training of the NN , we took the output of each NN given the same image in different mode .The output is a number of probabilities , as much as the classes(objects) we want to classify. The probabilities then are gathered in one signle row , and are feeded as training input to a Fully Connected NN . This way , we can take into account the fact that e.g sand is glowing in reflectance , is black in transmission and in fluorescence it shows nothing at all , so we filter even further the psychical differences objects have under different lighting , and we achieve a very prominent result of 95% accuracy.
